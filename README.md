### Validation, linters and pull-requests

We want to provide high quality code and modules. For this reason we are using
several [pre-commit hooks](.pre-commit-config.yaml) and
[GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml). A pull-request to the
master branch will trigger these validations and lints automatically. Please
check your code before you will create pull-requests. See
[pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) and
[GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for further
